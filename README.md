# anupars


anupars (อนุภา(ส), meaning "tiny following light" in Thai), a Rust-based reimagining of [`anu`](https://github.com/karnpapon/anu) a musical sequencer driven by regular expressions, designed to operate on resource-constrained devices, and performance-oriented.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a **work in progress**. Features and APIs are subject to change anytime.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- A MIDI-capable application or device connected

## Option A — Download a pre-built binary (easiest)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/karnpapon/anupars/releases) and download the archive for your platform.
2. Extract and make the binary executable:

```sh
# macOS only, remove quarantine set by Gatekeeper on downloaded binaries
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./anupars
chmod +x ./anupars
./anupars
```

```powershell
# Windows — just double-click anupars.exe, or run from PowerShell:
.\anupars.exe
```

## Option B — Build from source

Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (stable).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/karnpapon/anupars.git
cd anupars
cargo run
```

## Quick Start

1. **Open the menubar** with `Ctrl+b`, the menubar will be shown at the top of terminal screen.
2. ~~**Click "anupars" > "Generate Text"**, enter a length for the generated text, then hit `Enter`, this fills the grid editor with content (you can also provide your own text in `Insert File` below `Generate Text` menu).~~ (obsoleted for v0.2.0)
3. **Click `anupars` > `MIDI`** ensure you select the right MIDI output.
4. **Type a regex**, the matching cells are highlighted on the grid in real time.
5. **Press `Esc`** to switch between the regex input and the grid editor section (there's a little indicator to tell which section is currently selected).
6. the playhead will be initialises at position (0, 0) top-left (since it initialized with len=1 so you might trying to look for it).
7. **Move the playhead** with `h / j / k / l` (vim-style) or click directly on the canvas.
8. **Scale playhead** with `Shift` modifier key, along with move key (`h / j / k / l`) or just mouse dragging.
9. **Leap playhead** similar to how `Orca` leap, you can use modifier key `Alt` (or `Option` in osx) combine with move key and scale key.
10. **Press `Space`** to start playback, the playhead steps through cells that match your pattern (try increasing beat division by `}` if you want to make it faster).
11. **Change tempo** with `>` (faster) and `<` (slower).
12. to enable mode use `Ctrl` along with available mode chars (`a`, `n`, `u`, `e`, `s`,`y`, `z` you can easily see theses being displayed on the top of the screen) let's start with `sweep` mode using `Ctrl+s` the active mode with change from lowercase to uppercase mode the crosshair appears and it'll trigger all the trigger point along y-axis (the velocity is based-on the trigger point distance to the playhead (in y-axis), the far from playhead, the lower velocity), all modes is togglable all default to off initially.
13. the top spatial keyboard layout (inspired by Music Mouse - Laurie Spiegel) will hint you what note is being triggered, where
  - `#` represent black-key
  - `━` represent white-key
  - long-vertical represent natural C
  - the number in long-vertical key is an octave
14. a **left keyboard** (vertical layout) is also available — press `~` to toggle between top keyboard (`[  ∧  ]`) and left keyboard (`[  ∨  ]`). When the left keyboard is active, notes vary along the y-axis (each row is a pitch) instead of the x-axis.
15. try changing scale by `Shift+Plus` (scale up) or `Shift+Underscore` (scale down); use `(` / `)` to change the left keyboard scale directly
16. changing root note by `=` (root note up) or `-` (down); use `9` / `0` to change the left keyboard root note directly


That's all you need for a first session. Explore [Features](#features) and [Keybindings](#keybindings-reference) whenever you're ready to go deeper.

# Features

- **Tiny Binary Size**
  - Optimized for minimal footprint (~855 KB) - release builds use `opt-level = "z"`, `lto`, and symbol stripping, producing a small self-contained binary suitable for resource-constrained devices.

- **MIDI In/Out Selector**
  - Choose from available MIDI devices for flexible routing to synths, DAWs, or hardware.

- **MIDI In (Clock Sync)**
  - When MIDI input clock messages are enabled (default: `disabled`), the app will listen for incoming MIDI `Start/Stop/Continue/Clock` messages and synchronize playback to an external master clock.
  - **Note**: enabling MIDI input clock-sync disables the spacebar `play/pause` control to avoid conflicting local and external transport control. Disable MIDI input if you want to use the spacebar locally.

- **MIDI Out Clock Features**
  - Implements standard MIDI clock transport messages for external device:
    - `Start` Sends MIDI Start (`0xFA`) to begin playback from the start.
    - `Stop` Sends MIDI Stop (`0xFC`) to halt playback.
    - `Tick` Sends MIDI Clock (`0xF8`) for timing synchronization (24 per quarter note ([PPQN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_beat_clock))).
    - `Continue` Sends MIDI Continue (`0xFB`) to resume playback from the current position.
    - `Song Position Pointer` (SPP) Sends MIDI Song Position Pointer (`0xF2`) to set the playback position in beats.

- **Dual Spatial Keyboard Layout**
  - Two independent on-screen keyboards inspired by Laurie Spiegel's [Music Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Mouse), enabling expressive, algorithmic play.
  - **Top keyboard** (horizontal layout): notes vary along the **x-axis** — each column is a distinct pitch. The keyboard strip is drawn across the top of the grid.
  - **Left keyboard** (vertical layout): notes vary along the **y-axis** — each row is a distinct pitch. The keyboard strip is drawn along the left edge of the grid.
  - Press `~` to toggle between the two keyboards. The active keyboard is shown as `[  ∧  ]` (top) or `[  ∨  ]` (left) at the top-left of the canvas.
  - Scale mode and root note changes (`Shift++`, `Shift+_`, `=`, `-`) apply to whichever keyboard is currently active.
  - The left keyboard also has **dedicated shortcuts** that always target it regardless of the active keyboard: `(` / `)` cycle scale mode, `9` / `0` adjust root note.
  - Sweep mode always uses the top keyboard regardless of the active selection.

- **Separated Scale Change for Vertical/Horizontal Steps**
  - Independently assign musical scales for vertical (Y-axis) and horizontal (X-axis) movement, allowing complex modal and harmonic explorations.

- **Movement**
  - Instantly change running direction of the sequencer, creating evolving or retrograde patterns at the touch.
    - Forward
    - Reverse
    - Pendulum
    - Random

- **Arpeggiator Mode**
  - When enabled, the sequencer steps only through positions matching the current regex, producing arpeggiator-like melodic patterns from your rules.

- **Accumulation Mode (Semi Self-Configuration)**
  - Activate accumulation mode to let the system semi-autonomously reconfigure itself via [Queue System](#queue-system), stacking and evolving patterns for emergent musical results.

- **Drone Mode**
  - A sustained-note layer that runs independently of the sequencer playback. Toggle with `Ctrl+o`.
  - When active, a vertical drone line appears at the left edge of the playhead area. Every row with a regex match at that x-column is held simultaneously, producing a chord that sustains until the line moves or the mode is toggled off.
  - Notes use the **left keyboard** scale (`scale_mode_left` / `scale_root_left`) with y-axis velocity (higher rows = louder). Cells inside the playhead area are excluded to avoid overlap with the sequencer trigger.
  - Move the drone line with `i` (left) / `p` (right), held notes fade out with a short tail before the new position fires, enabling smooth chord transitions.
  - Cycle the MIDI output channel with `I` (decrease) / `P` (increase), wrapping through channels 1–16. When a non-default channel is selected it is shown in the status bar as `O<ch>` (e.g. `O<3>`). Changing the scale root or scale mode via `9` / `0` / `(` / `)` retriggers the drone automatically.

- **Modes** (shown in status bar; uppercase = active)
  - `a`: Arpeggiator (see above)
  - `n`: Drain Queue
  - `u`: Accumulation (see above)
  - `e`: Event Operator, enables event operator triggering from keyboard.
  - `s`: Sweep, sweeps through positions across the playhead range.
  - `o`: Drone, sustains matched notes at a movable vertical line (see Drone Mode above).
  - `y`: Dynamic Length, playhead length adjusts dynamically.
  - `z`: Freeze, locks the active position and retriggers MIDI at that cell each DIV tick (it's quantized to the beat).

- **Sweep Tilt (TLT)**
Controls the angle of the sweep crosshair. **this mode should be used with "Sweep" mode**, it moves like a "Bishop" movement in chess. Each triggered cell fires on the MIDI channel matching its visual column band
Cycles through three modes displayed in the status bar:
    - `|` Vertical (default): crosshair sweeps straight down, same column for every row.
    - `\` DiagDown: crosshair shifts one column right per row below the playhead, left per row above (like a `\` diagonal).
    - `/` DiagUp: crosshair shifts one column left per row below the playhead, right per row above (like a `/` diagonal).

- **Sweep Row Mode**
Filters which rows the sweep crosshair draws on and triggers MIDI from. **requires Sweep mode to be active**. The active sub-mode is shown inline in the mode status bar after the `S` character (e.g. `S<O>`).
Cycles through four modes with `|`:
    - Normal (default): every row is active — identical to previous sweep behaviour.
    - `O` Odd rows only (rows 1, 3, 5 …): even rows are silenced and not rendered.
    - `E` Even rows only (rows 0, 2, 4 …): odd rows are silenced and not rendered.
    - `R` Random: each row is independently gated by a deterministic hash of its index, producing a fixed sparse pattern.

- **Scale Selection**
  - Scale root selectable across all 12 chromatic pitches (C–B).

  | 1 | `Chromatic` | |
  | 2 | `Major` | |

# Queue System

Inpspired by [Event Loop](https://medium.com/@ignatovich.dm/the-javascript-event-loop-explained-with-examples-d8f7ddf0861d), the queue is a first-in-first-out (`FIFO`) dispatch mechanism, events accumulate, wait, and are consumed one at a time, each driving a state transition in the sequencer. every jump or timbral gesture is the result of something that was previously enqueued.

it comprised of 
- **Event Queue (EVQ)** holds pending event operators to be fused into the next push, current available ops are
  - `c` / `>CHORD` chord event triggers a triad.
  - `h` / `>HOLDN` hold event sustains the note.
  - `r` / `>RTCHT` ratheting (re-triggering) the note.
- **Queue Operators** spatially mapped on keyboard, current available ops are
  - `P` Push, push current playhead position (or front event) onto OPQ.
  - `S` Swap, swap the top two items in OPQ.
  - `O` Pop, execute and remove the front item from OPQ.
  - `D` Duplicate, duplicate the top item in OPQ.

## Platform Notes

- **macOS**: Option key (⌥) is used for leap and large scale adjustments
- **Linux/Windows**: Alt key behaves similarly to Option on macOS for leap functions
- **Cross-platform**: Vim-style hjkl keys work consistently across all platforms

## Implementation Details

- Arrow keys have been removed in favor of vim-style navigation
- Platform-specific key combinations use `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` compilation flags
- Minimum playhead area size is enforced (1×1) to prevent overflow errors
